Validation Scripts in Bitcoin
=============================
This is an educational project that I'm using to learn about how Bitcoin transactions are validated.

Usage
-----
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the project directory
3. Make a virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python3 venv`
4. `source` the virtual environment activation script - e.g. `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
